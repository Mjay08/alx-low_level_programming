this is a basic command line input practice, used in understanding elements of argv and do simple arithmetic.



task 0-is a program that prints its name, and then a new line.

*If the program is renamed, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again

*The part should be removed before the name of the program

task 1-is a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it. -the program prints a number, followed by a new line



task 2-is a program that prints all arguments it receives.



*All arguments should be printed, including the first one

*we print one argument per line, then end with a new line

task 3-is a program that multiplies two numbers.

* the program should print the result of the multiplication, a new line and you can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer 

*the program should print error if the program does not receive two arguments then followed by a new line, and return 1.



task 4-is a program that adds positive numbers. 

*it prints the result, followed by a new line 

*If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line 

*If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1 

*You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int



task 5-is a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money. -Usage: ./change cents 

*here, cents is the amount of cents you need to give back 

*if the number of arguments passed to your program is not exactly 1, the program prints Error, followed by a new line, and return 1 

*you should use atoi to parse the parameter passed to your program 

*If the number passed as the argument is negative, print 0, followed by a new line 

*You can use an unlimited number of coins of values 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent
